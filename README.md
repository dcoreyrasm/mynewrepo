# mynewrepo
This is a description for my new repo.


The general format of a README includes:

•	Project name.
•	A description of your project, and what it does.
•	A table of contents, particularly if there are multiple sections.
•	Installation instructions.
•	Usage instructions after installation. It is also a good practice to include screenshots to help the user understand any steps involved. 
•	Contributing to the project. For the application created in this course, you will not invite contributors. However, in larger, real-world projects, you might ask other developers to contribute to the project. You’d need to provide instructions on how to do this and include guidelines as well. 
•	Credits – You should include a section to highlight the author(s) of your project.
•	License – Always include a license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, review GitHub’s licensing guide: https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/ 
•	A link to your README, which should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project.
